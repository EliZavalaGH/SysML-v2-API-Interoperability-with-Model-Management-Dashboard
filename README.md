This project explains the creation of a SysML v2 API Scripts Python library and a Python dashboard interface that
leverages said library with the objective of increasing accessibility to, and facilitate analysis of, SysML v2 server model
via the new, standardized API. Given a SysML v2 model uploaded to the server, any user should be able to access said model and all its
respective data solely through the dashboard, complete bypassing any prior knowledge required to handle APIs.

For key resources used to build this capability, please refer to the report and its resources section for their links.
